I have installed Openshot 2.4.2 in Windows 10 and, just after loading the screen, i get this window: 

Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime library
Runtime Error!
Program C:\Program Files\OpenShot Video Editor\Launch.exe
This application has requested the Runtime to terminate in an unnusual way
Please contact the application's support team for more information.

Strange thing is the program worked the first time I used it (I made a video). I've tried reinstalling and reinstalling Visual C++ too.
I use Windows 10, and the Pc is a Rizen 5 with 8 GB RAM.

Hope someone can help, thanks in advanse.
